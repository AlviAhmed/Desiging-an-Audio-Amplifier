# Desiging-an-Audio-Amplifier
Goal of this is to design an audio amplifier by building it from the ground up using calculations, simulations and finally experimentation 

Even though I posted calculations of both the LM741 and the LM318, in the end I decided to go with and simulate and experiment with 
LM741, since it was the cheapest of the 2.  

Later on down the road, I will apply this type of circuit to amplify the sound from a Electret Microphone.
