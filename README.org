#+TITLE: Designing an Audio Amplifier
#+AUTHOR: Alvi Ahmed

*Status:* Completed 
*Type:* ELE504 Lab


* Objective 

The objective of this lab was to design a practical audio microphone
amplifier. At the same time the DC imperfections of the LM741 Op-Amp
were investigated and strategies to minimize the overall DC effects
were implemented. 

Comparisons of different types of Op-Amps were also made, mainly
between the LM741 and the LM318. The frequency response and the slew
rate limitations of each Op-Amp were investigated. 

The goal was to design  the circuit in such a way that the slew rate and cutoff frequency limitations of the op-amp do not affect the signal. Later on taking into account the DC offset when working with microphones.

The specifications of the circuit are:
Vi = 10mv (pk-pk)
Vo = 5V (pk-pk)
Desired Bandwidth = 100Hz - 20kHz
Aclo = 500 V/V

The audio amplifier will either be made from an LM741 or LM318,
eventually I chose to use 2 LM741's since I only had those available
to me at the time.


Tests and simulations as well as lab work were done for the LM741 circuit. As seen in the oscilloscope screenshots the circuit works well to amplify the signal within the desired bandwidth (100Hz - 20kHz).

The next step of this project would be to use an actual microphone and amplify its sound so that it is audible in a small speaker.

Microphone planning to use => Electret microphone, Model #: 07-9
Speaker planning to use => McBridge AZ-30s.

The image above is page 1 of the calculations for LM318. 


For this project I will be going with the LM741 version of the
amplifier circuit. Even though the LM318 version of the circuit is
cheaper since only 1 op-amp is needed as opposed to 2 LM741 Op-Amps at
this time I only have LM741 op-amps at my disposal.    

* Simulation in NI Multisim 

** Circuit Being Simulated

** Input Voltage (10mV (pk-pk) @ 20kHz):

** Input Voltage (5V (pk-pk) @ 20kHz):

In conclusion the schematic seems to be working well in simulation,
therefore it is time to build it and see if the results hold in the
real world.

* Conclusion 

It seems that LM741 amplifier circuit is working according to specifications. 

Therefore the next step after this will be to  apply the microphone
and speaker circuitry and observe if it correctly amplifies the voice
/ input audio source.

However it should be noted that further calculations will have to be
made to avoid distortion and noise. I am mainly talking about the
potential for DC offset and bias currents, which will have to be
nulled out.
